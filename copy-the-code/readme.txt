== How to Use ==

There are 5 ways to use the "Copy Anything to Clipboard" plugin:

1. **NEW: [Global Injector](https://clipboard.agency/doc/usage/global-injector/)** - Advanced injection with display conditions
2. [Automatically with "CSS Selector"](https://clipboard.agency/doc/usage/css-selectors/)
3. [Manually with "Shortcode"](https://clipboard.agency/doc/usage/shortcode/)
4. Manually with "Elementor widgets"
5. Manually with "Gutenberg blocks"

=== METHOD 1 – Global Injector (NEW in v5.0.0)

The Global Injector is the most powerful way to add copy buttons to your website. It provides:

* **Display Conditions** - Control where copy buttons appear (specific pages, posts, categories, etc.)
* **Multiple Style Presets** - Button, Icon, and Cover styles with live preview
* **Advanced Targeting** - Target specific CSS selectors with precision
* **Performance Optimized** - Assets load only where needed

==== How to Use Global Injector?

- **Step 1** – Go to "Copy to Clipboard" → "Global Injector"
- **Step 2** – Click "Add New Injector"
- **Step 3** – Configure your CSS selector (e.g., `pre`, `code`, `blockquote`)
- **Step 4** – Choose your style preset (Button, Icon, or Cover)
- **Step 5** – Set display conditions (optional)
- **Step 6** – Save and preview your changes

=== METHOD 2 – Automatically with "CSS Selector"

This is the quick, most useful way and is mostly used by a lot of users with this plugin.

Use this method, if you want to add the copy button automatically to all the elements with the same selector.

**Example 1:** If your website post contains code snippets in the `<pre>` tag, then by setting the `pre` tag as selector in "Copy Anything to Clipboard", it will automatically add the copy button to all the `pre` tags. Your users can copy the code snippet with just a click.

**Example 2:** Your blog post has blockquotes and you want to add the copy button to the blockquote. Simply set `blockquote` as your CSS selector and all blockquotes will have copy buttons automatically.

==== How to Use with CSS Selector?

- **Step 1** – Go to “Copy to Clipboard”
- **Step 2** – Click on the “Add New” button
- **Step 3** – Add the selector. E.g. `pre` or `blockquote`
- **Step 4** – Click on “Create”
- **Step 5** – Visit the page and see the copy button

- [Add the copy button to Code Snippet](https://clipboard.agency/blog/add-copy-button-to-code-snippet/)

=== METHOD 3 – Manually with "Shortcode"

You can use this method if you want to add the copy button to the specific element.

Use the shortcode `[copy]` or `[copy_inline]` shortcodes.

E.g.

<code>
The zoom meeting is scheduled on data [copy]15 November 2022[/copy] please note down it.
</code>

==== How to Use with Shortcode?

You may use the shortcode `[copy_inline]` to copy the inline content.

E.g.

<code>
Contact us:

- Email: [copy_inline text="contact@clipboard.agency"]
- Phone: [copy_inline text="+91 1234567890"]
- Address: [copy_inline text="123, Street, City, State, Country"]
- Website: [copy_inline text="https://clipboard.agency/"]
- Facebook: [copy_inline text="https://www.facebook.com/clipboard.agency/"]
</code>

Or, Use it as coupon code:

<code>
Use coupon code [copy_inline text="COUPONCODE"] to get 10% discount.
</code>

Or, Use it as deal:

<code>
Get the deal [copy_inline text="https://clipboard.agency/deal/"] to get 10% discount.
</code>

Or, Use for username and password:

<code>
Username: [copy_inline text="username"]
Password: [copy_inline text="password" display="*********"]
</code>
